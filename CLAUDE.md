## Standard Workflow

1. First think through the problem, read the codebase for relevant files, and write a plan to tasks/todo.md
2. Tha plan shoul have a list of todo items that you can check off as you comlete them.
3. Before you begin working, ckeck in with me and I will verifu the plan.
4. Then, begon working on the todo items, marking them as complete as you go.
5. Please every step of the way just give me a high level explanation of what changes you made
6. Make every task and code change you do as simple as possible. We want to avoid makin any massive or complex changes. Every change should impact as little code as possible. Everything is about simplicity
7. Finally, add a review section to the todo.md file with a summary of the changes you made and any other relevant information.
